Hello there! I uploaded this because i wanted a simple interactive GUI for everyone. The key is not hard to get (dont tell me it is, since its literally in the project and its called key.txt) and it does not get 190237123 linkvertise
ads.

The script was originally made for Insane Elevator but i think its usable in other games too. The thing contains some options like fly, noclip, walk speed and more. Also it can change lighting (CLIENT) to your liking (this is useful when there is too much
fog lol). You can inject the code by going to InjectionCode.lua and copying the code into your executor

Hope you have a great day, (maybe) fellow exploiter!
