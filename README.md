Hello there! I uploaded this because i wanted a simple interactive GUI for everyone. The key is not hard to get (dont tell me it is, since its literally in the project and its called key.txt) and it does not get 190237123 linkvertise
ads.

The script was originally made for Insane Elevator but i think its usable in other games too. The thing contains some options like fly, noclip, walk speed and more. Also it can change lighting (CLIENT) to your liking (this is useful when there is too much
fog lol). Also there is a button for Infinite Yield AND I DID NOT MAKE IT, CREDITS TO THE DEVELOPER. Yeah i know there are millions of these, but isnt it fun to make your own one in which you can add functions to your liking?

Hope you have a great day, (maybe) fellow exploiter!
